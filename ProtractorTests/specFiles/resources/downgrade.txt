To Downgrade follow these steps:

1.Clean the webdrivers already installed:

	webdriver-manager clean

2.Update the webdriver with specific version:

webdriver-manager update --ie --versions.standalone=3.4.0 --versions.ie=3.4.0(ex: --versions.chrome=))

3.Start webdriver with specific version:

webdriver-manager start --versions.standalone=3.4.0 
webdriver-manager update --versions.standalone=3.2.0

npm install -g selenium-webdriver@2.47.0

npm install -g protractor@5.1.1


In the simplest terms, the tilde matches the most recent minor version (the middle number). 
~1.2.3 will match all 1.2.x versions but will miss 1.3.0.

The caret, on the other hand, is more relaxed. It will update you to the most recent 
major version (the first number). ^1.2.3 will match any 1.x.x release including 1.3.0,
but will hold off on 2.0.0.

~version "Approximately equivalent to version" See npm semver - Tilde Ranges & semver (7)
^version "Compatible with version" See npm semver - Caret Ranges & semver (7)
version Must match version exactly
>version Must be greater than version
>=version etc
<version
<=version
